  // "The House Of The Rising Sun"
  // -- by The Animals
  //
  // There is a house in New Orleans
  // They call the Rising Sun
  // And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
  // And God, I know I'm one
  //
  // My mother was a tailor
  // She sewed my new blue jeans
  // My father was a gamblin' man
  // Down in New Orleans
  //
  // Now the only thing a gambler needs
  // Is a suitcase and trunk
  // And the only time he's satisfied
  // Is when he's on a drunk
  //
  // [Organ Solo]
  //
  // Oh mother, tell your children
  // Not to do what I have done
  // Spend your lives in sin and misery
  // In the House of the Rising Sun
  //
  // Well, I got one foot on the platform
  // The other foot on the train
  // I'm goin' back to New Orleans
  // To wear that ball and chain
  //
  // Well, there is a house in New Orleans
  // They call the Rising Sun
  // And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
  // And God, I know I'm one.
