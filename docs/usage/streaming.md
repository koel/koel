# Streaming Music

## Streaming Methods

Koel supports three streaming methods which can be configured via the `STREAMING_METHOD` setting in `.env` file:

* `php`: Uses native PHP file reading. This is the default method.
* `x-accel-redirect`: Only applicable if your webserver is nginx. Uses
  nginx's [X-Accel](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/x-accel/) module, designed for serving
  larger contents directly to the end user. Refer to [
  `nginx.conf.example`](https://github.com/koel/koel/blob/master/nginx.conf.example) for a sample nginx configuration
  file.
* `x-sendfile`: Only applicable if your webserver is Apache (with or without a proxy server like nginx). Uses
  Apache's [mod_xsendfile](https://tn123.org/mod_xsendfile/) module. You'll need to install and configure the module
  manually. A sample configuration is as following:
    ```apache
    LoadModule xsendfile_module   libexec/apache2/mod_xsendfile.so

    # These configuration can be put in the VirtualHost directive as well
    <IfModule mod_xsendfile.c>
      XSendFile on
      XSendFilePath /mnt/media
    </IfModule>
    ```
  Note that although its home page denotes "Apache2/Apache2.2," the module itself is known to work with later versions
  of Apache as well.

:::tip Tip
If you're using [Koel mobile app](https://koel.dev/#mobile) and can't play the songs, try switching the streaming method
to `x-accel-redirect` or `x-sendfile` instead of `php`.

:::warning Notice
Koel always uses the native PHP method if you're streaming from a cloud storage.

## Transcoding

Koel can transcode your audio to cater to specific needs. To support transcoding, you'll need to
have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
installed on your server and set its executable path via the `FFMPEG_PATH` setting in the `.env` file. The transcoding
quality can also be controlled via `OUTPUT_BIT_RATE` (defaults to `128`).

When transcoding is enabled, Koel caches the transcoded files to improve performance. If for any reason you want to
clear the cache, run `php artisan cache:clear`.

:::warning Important
Transcoding is only supported for local storage. FTP and cloud storage drivers are not supported.

### FLAC Transcoding

By default, Koel streams FLAC files as-is, which means the lossless audio quality is preserved.
However, you can opt to have FLAC transcoded to mp3 to, for example, reduce bandwidth or support older devices.
This behavior can be controlled via the `TRANSCODE_FLAC` setting in `.env` file:

* `false`: Disable transcoding and stream FLAC files as-is, producing the lossless audio quality. This is the default
  behavior.
* `true`: Transcode FLAC to mp3 before streaming.

### Forced Transcoding

For audio formats that aren't widely supported by browsers, such as AIFF, Koel will always resort to transcoding. If you
upload files in such formats, make sure the FFmpeg setup and configuration (see above) are correct.

### Transcoding on Mobile

On a mobile device where data usage is a concern, the user might want to instruct Koel to transcode all songs to a lower
bitrate to save bandwidth. This can be done via the [Preferences screen](./profile-preferences#preferences).
