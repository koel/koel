# Artist, Album, and Playlist Arts

If [integrated](../service-integrations) Koel will attempt to fetch artists' images and album arts from Spotify,
Last.fm, or MusicBrainz/Wikipedia whenever a song is played. You can upload custom images for artists, albums, and
playlists via the corresponding edit form.

If there is no image available for an artist or album, Koel will use a default image (the Koel bird logo).
For a playlist, a random "thumbnail stack" will be generated and used based on the tracks.
