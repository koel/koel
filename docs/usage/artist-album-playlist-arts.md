# Artist, Album, and Playlist Arts

If [integrated](../service-integrations) Koel will attempt to fetch artists' images and album arts from Spotify,
Last.fm, or MusicBrainz/Wikipedia whenever a song is played. You can upload custom images for artists, albums, and
playlists via the corresponding edit form.

If there is no available for artist and album, Koel will use a default image (the Koel bird logo).
For a playlist, a random "thumbnail stack" will be generated and used based on the tracks.
