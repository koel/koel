# What is Koel?

A complete music streaming solution that hosts and streams your own music collection, Koel (also stylized as koel, with a lowercase k) is designed to be:

* **Modern and snappy** – Unlike some of our music, we’re not living in the 90s anymore. Koel looks and functions like a true modern application: clean, gorgeous, and fast. As a matter of fact, it won’t even work on prehistoric browsers.
* **Easy to set up** – Born from a personal frustration of failing to find something easy to install, Koel is dead-simple to get up and running, utilizing some of the most popular and proven technologies in the web development world: [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* **Easy to use** – As Koel’s interface draws inspiration from proven streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, you will feel right at home where everything is exactly where you’d expect it to be.
* **Feature-rich** – Apart from the standard functionalities (stream, search, song/album/artist browsing, playlist management, etc.), Koel provides advanced features like smart playlists, equalizer, visualizers, 3rd-service integrations, and many more.
* **Open source** – Koel’s source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.conm/koel/koel) under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit), meaning you can use it for free and even contribute to its development. To help finance the project, you can either purchase [Koel Plus](/plus/what-is-koel-plus), get the [mobile app](/mobile-apps), or [become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/phanan).

:::tip TL;DR
Koel is a music streaming solution that actually works™.
