# White Labeling

Another Plus-only feature is the ability to customize the branding of the app, a practice commonly known as
"white-labeling." Koel Plus users with administrative privileges can change the app name, logo, and the default cover
image used for artists, albums, and other media without an associated artwork. These settings can be found on the
"Settings" page, under the "Branding" section.

::: tip
For the best visual results, use a square image of at least 512Ã—512 pixels for the logo and the cover.
SVG is fully supported and recommended.
