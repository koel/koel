# What is Koel Plus?

## Introduction

Koel Plus is the premium version of Koel. It offers additional features and enhancements on top of the Community edition, including but not limited to:

- **Multi-library Support**: In Koel Plus, each user has their own library, which they populate by uploading their own music.
- **Music Sharing**: By default, uploaded music is private to the user who uploaded it. However, users can choose to share their music with others by marking songs as public.
- **[Collaboration](./collaboration)**: Users can invite others to collaborate on their playlists, allowing them to add, remove, and reorder songs.
- **[Cloud Storage Support](./cloud-storage-support)**: In addition to local storage, Koel Plus supports remote and cloud storage drivers like SFTP, Amazon S3 (or any S3-compatible service), and Dropbox.
- **[Single Sign-On (SSO) Support](./sso)**: Users can log into Koel Plus using their existing credentials from another service like Google.

Other features are being planned or actively developed, for example:

- **Authentication via Proxy-Authorization Header**: Seamlessly log in users who are already authenticated via a proxy server, allowing Koel to be used in a corporate environment.
- **Refined Roles & Permissions**: Create custom roles and assign them to users, controlling what they can and cannot do.
- **Custom Themes**: Allow users to customize the look and feel of Koel in addition to the built-in themes.

## Do you need Koel Plus?
Since Koel Plus's flagship feature is multi-library support, it's most useful in a multi-user environment, such as a family or an organization.
If you're a single user, you might not need Koel Plus.

However, if you want to host your media files on a cloud storage service like Amazon S3 or Dropbox, you'll need Koel Plus.
[Purchasing Koel Plus](./purchase-activation) is also a good way to support the active development of Koel.
