# The storage driver. Valid values are:
# local: Store files on the server's local filesystem.

# The ABSOLUTE path to your media. This value can always be changed later via the web interface.
# Required if you're using the local file system to store your media (STORAGE_DRIVER=local).
MEDIA_PATH=/srv/koel/media


# By default, Koel ignores dot files and folders. This greatly improves performance if your media
# root have folders like .git or .cache. If by any chance your media files are under a dot folder,
# set the following setting to false.
IGNORE_DOT_FILES=true


# The maximum scan time, in seconds. Increase this if you have a huge library.
# Note: This setting doesn't have effect when scanning via koel:sync.

# For example, if you want to set a memory limit of 2048MB, enter "2048" (without

# The streaming method.
# Can be either 'php' (default), 'x-sendfile', or 'x-accel-redirect'
# See https://docs.koel.dev/usage/streaming for more information.
# Note: This setting doesn't have effect if the media needs transcoding (e.g. FLAC).

# Full text search driver.
# Koel supports all drivers supported by Laravel (see https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/scout).

# For Algolia or MeiliSearch, you need to provide the corresponding credentials.

# Whether to allow song downloading.
# Note that if you're downloading more than one song, Koel will zip them up
