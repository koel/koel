**Koel** (also styled as **koel**, with a lowercase k) is a simple web-based personal audio streaming service written in [Vue](http://vuejs.org/) at the client side and [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) on server side. Targetting web developers, Koel embraces some of the more modern web technologies – flexbox, audio and drag-and-drop API to name a few – to do its job.
